Summary
=======
LISA provides an interface for a variety of sampling algorithms.  Currently, 
the following sampling methods are available:
    DE-MC (ter Braak 2006), via a fork (https://github.com/mdhimes/mc3/tree/mpi)
                            of MC3 (https://github.com/pcubillos/mc3)
    DE-MC with snooker updates (ter Braak & Vrugt 2008), via MC3 fork
    MULTINEST (Feroz et al. 2009), via PyMultiNest (Buchner et al. 2014)
                                (https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/PyMultiNest)
    UltraNest (Buchner 2014, 2019; https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/UltraNest)
